# Project Overview
The business domain that was selected by the team members is an online glasses and sunglasses shopping site named Anotherspecs that allows users to explore products from our brand. In this project, the members are assigned to design and develop a front-ended section of the web application (UI) using the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; all pages are hosted in the front-end server; and a back-ended section (database and web services) using the combination of Node.js and JavaScript; all components are hosted in the back-end server.

The project will be delivered in two phases. The first phase plan prioritizes the website's visual design using HTML and CSS to build the front-end. This includes essential pages like Home, Search, Product details, About Us, and dedicated admin sections for login, add account, product management, and information management.

The second phase tackles the website's internal system. This involves creating a database to store administrator and product information. The team will then develop web services for core functionalities: administrator login (authentication), product management (search, view, insert, update, delete), and administrator information management (similar functionalities for administrator data). Finally, these services will be integrated with the user interface and a public Currency Data API to enable real-time currency conversion.

These are some sample pages that were developed.
